## Welcome to the DREAM data stack! 

**Here is how to get you started:**

* [Download Pycharm community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=PCC)
  
* On the welcome screen in Pycharm, click **Get from VCS**
  * If you already have a project open, instead go to File > Project from Version Control
    
* Select git as the version control system, and enter the URL of our org repo: https://github.com/DREAM-Charter-Schools/All-Kids-Can.git then click clone
  * If this gives you a repo not found error, you must create a personal access token. Click on your portrait in the top right > settings > Developer settings > Tokens (classic) > generate new token (classic). Give it a name, expiration date, and click all of the boxes. Use that token when authenticating. You'll need this token to push changes as well.
  * Hoping to fix the above workaround soon!
  
* Ensure your python interpreter is set correctly in pycharm via File > Settings> Project:DREAM > Python Interpreter. If you do not have an interpreter selected, click Add Interpreter, ensure that "New" and "VirtualEnv" are selected, then click Ok to install the latest version of python
  
* Start coding!
